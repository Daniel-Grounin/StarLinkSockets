# StarLinkSockets

## Overview
This project demonstrates various socket communication tests using Python and C++. The main goal is to establish real-time data transfer and explore different approaches to socket-based communication.

## Structure
- **satallite_client.cpp**: A C++ client implementation for testing socket communication with the Python server.
- **socket_test1.py**: A basic Python socket server example.
- **socket_test2.py**: An enhanced server version with additional features.
- **sockets_test3.py**: A final test implementing real-time data transmission with error handling and improved performance.

## How It Works
1. **Python Socket Server**: Receives data from multiple clients and processes it in real time.
2. **C++ Client**: Connects to the Python server, sends data, and receives responses.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   
2. Build and run the C++ client using your preferred IDE.

3. Run the Python server scripts to test different socket functionalities.

Requirements
Python 3.x: Ensure Python is installed along with necessary libraries (socket and others as required).
C++ Compiler: Ensure you have a working C++ compiler.
OpenFrameworks (for the C++ part): Necessary for graphical rendering if utilized in the C++ code.
